# Development

The starter code of this project is provided [here](https://github.com/udacity/fend/tree/refresh-2019/projects/weather-journal-app), but I decided to develop this project from scratch using the free design from [Untitled UI](https://www.untitledui.com/).

This project is built using third-party resources as follow:

-   Quicksand and Reenie Beanie fonts from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)
-   Weather API by [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/)
